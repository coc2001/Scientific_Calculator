# Scientific_Calculator
This is a scientific calculator implemented using Java Swing. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing various scientific calculations.<br>

**Features**<br>
* Standard Operations: The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>
* Scientific Functions: It includes a range of scientific functions, including square root, exponentiation, logarithm, trigonometric functions, and more.<br>
* Expression Evaluation: Users can enter complex mathematical expressions, which are evaluated correctly based on the order of operations.<br>
* User-Friendly Interface: The GUI provides a clean and intuitive interface for easy interaction.<br>

**Prerequisites**<br>

To run the scientific calculator, ensure that you have the following installed:<br>

Java Development Kit (JDK) - version 8 or later<br>

**How to Use**<br>
* Launch the calculator application.
* Use the buttons provided on the GUI to enter numbers and perform calculations.<br>
* For basic arithmetic operations, click on the respective buttons (+, -, *, /) followed by the numbers.<br>
* For scientific functions, click on the corresponding buttons (sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, etc.) and then enter the value.<br>
* To evaluate a mathematical expression, type it in the input field and click the "=" button.<br>
* The result will be displayed in the output field.<br>

**Acknowledgments**<br>

* The design and layout of the calculator GUI were inspired by various scientific calculators available in the market.
* Thanks to the Java Swing library for providing the tools to create the graphical user interface.
